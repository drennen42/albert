# Albert

## Summary
Albert is a scheduling and tracking tool for event-based companies.  With Albert, owners and managers can schedule events, add employees, track employees hours, calculate payroll, and more.  Employees will also be able to track the events they are working and see events they are invited to sign up to work.  They can also view timesheets and their own payroll information (how much they are owed, how much they have made, etc).
